# gMapRoute
on a route, google maps shows options to a keyword like "sushi" or "fast food". 
when condensed, it shows the frequency of options in a bubble instead.

## Google API

- [google places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search)
- [google route API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview)
- [google maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)

## Developing

There will be a lot of messing up and 
rework with this plus the managing of costs 
with the amount of requests sent.

The plan of action for this project
is getting a route from the user
putting that route into Route API,
see what kind of information we get back from
that API, and most likely will have lat and lng coordinates

From there, getting a key word like "fast food" or "sushi", etc
and having that appear on the route as options.

In the future, having the options appear on the map focused
If condensed, have frequency of options in a bubble instead.
