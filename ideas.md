# Ideas

1. what software will you use for testing (postman, go, js, etc)
1. what are the headers and parameters needed for GET requests
	- route
	- places
1. How can you divide the route into smaller pieces
	- steps?
1. How can I get the long and lat of the smaller pieces
1. Use Places API with those smaller pieces to get places from keyword

1. Do you need a Google API key.
	- If yes, then develop much as possible without it.
1. Use google's stackoverflow and other documentation to 
minimise the use of the API while developing it.
